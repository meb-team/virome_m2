# Description of the filtering

The filtering of contigs is an important step because it aims to keep only representative contigs.
Thus, we delete all the clusters containing less than 2 contigs. Moreover, we delete every cluster containing less than 2 prediction tools.
This filtering guarantee to keep only double-cross validated contigs for each cluster.
